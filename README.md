# üìä MCDM-Based Investment Decision Analysis

This project applies multiple **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** techniques to help evaluate and rank companies based on investment-related factors. The models used include:

- **TOPSIS** (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)
- **VIKOR** (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje)
- **ARAS** (Additive Ratio Assessment)
- **COPRAS** (Complex Proportional Assessment)

---

## üß† Objective

To support investors in selecting the best company by analyzing trade-offs between ROI, risk, investment time, and other financial indicators.

---

## üìÅ Contents

- `Final_Project.xlsx`: The source Excel file containing:
  - Company evaluation data
  - User-defined preferences
  - Model-specific ranking outputs (TOPSIS, VIKOR, ARAS, COPRAS)
  - Mean rank calculation
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and methodology

---

## üß∞ Tools & Techniques

- **Excel**: For data entry, modeling, and computations
- **Python (optional)**: For potential automation and visualization
- **MCDM Techniques**:
  - TOPSIS: Chooses the option closest to the ideal and farthest from the worst
  - VIKOR: Identifies compromise solutions in conflict-heavy decisions
  - ARAS: Uses additive utility functions to rank alternatives
  - COPRAS: Assesses both positive and negative criteria proportionally

## üìå Key Insights

- Company **3** ranked consistently well in **VIKOR** and **COPRAS** models.
- There is **variation in rankings across different MCDM methods**, showing how each model interprets trade-offs differently.
- A **mean ranking** was calculated to combine individual model results into a final overall ranking.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Financial investment decision-making
- Portfolio optimization
- Supplier or project selection
- Strategic planning in uncertain or conflicting environments

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Open `Final_Project.xlsx` to explore the data and model outputs.
2. Add your preferences and criteria if you wish to simulate your own scenario.
3. Extend with Python for automation, normalization, and plotting (optional).
